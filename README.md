# Brainfuck in pure Nix

> A Brainfuck runtime, implemented in pure Nix

The inspiration of this project was [water-sucks's attempt](https://github.com/water-sucks/brainfuck.nix) on implementing Brainfuck using Nix. However, their approach could be considered cheating, since they only use Nix to convert Brainfuck code to C code.

- [ ] Support for [i-use-arch-btw](https://github.com/overmighty/i-use-arch-btw) [WIP]
